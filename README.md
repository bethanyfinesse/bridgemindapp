# BridgeMind

BridgeMind is a mobile app built with React Native and Expo that connects international students with therapists and peers who share similar cultural backgrounds. The app promotes accessible, inclusive, and culturally aware mental health support.

## Inspiration
Many international students face mental health challenges, cultural adjustment issues, and isolation while studying abroad. BridgeMind was created to offer a safe, understanding space for students to connect with professionals and peers who can truly relate.
